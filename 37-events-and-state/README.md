Events & State
==============

## SWBAT

- [x] Add event handlers to elements in React
- [x] Explain why we have Synthetic Events
- [ ] Correctly choose when to use `props` vs `state`, and explain why one would use one or the other
- [x] Instantiate `state` inside and outside of the `constructor`
- [x] Create event handler callbacks that manipulate `state`
- [x] Trigger rerenders by calling `setState`
- [ ] Manipulate the DOM by changing values in `state` instead of using vanilla JS
- [ ] Draw a component hierarchy and describe the Flow of Information

## Lecture Notes

```
add event listener <= add it to the ndoe
 = kinda do
add event type, handler <= callback
 = callbacks
do something when it hears the event <= the callback does something
```

### Event Handlers

- React wraps all events and tries its best to abstract them into a single API that _should_ act the same across browsers.
- This is one reason why React has what they call [_Synthetic Events_](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html).
- Another reason is so this same concept of a unified API layer can be used for other platforms. That way we only have to learn how events work in React once, then use the same concept everywhere - _learn once, write everywhere_. For example: Instead of `react-dom`, we use `react-native`.

### React Components

- Identify components with the _Single Responsibility Principle_
- Functional vs Class Components
  - Functional is almost always a Presentational Component
  - Functional Components are `state`less
  - Class Components can have `state` and lifecycle methods.
  - Class Components are `state`ful
- Attributes => `props`
- `return` / `render`
  - Must always return 1 object or an array of objects.
- Composition over Inheritance => we'll get to this eventually

### Props vs State

Learn by doing! Let's build something that needs state!

- [`state` is data that will change](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html).
- How do we define it?
  - `constructor` vs `state = {}`
- How do we change it?
  - **Never** mutate `state`!!!
  - Always **make copies** of `state`!!!
  - We change it with `setState`
- *Briefly* - Event Handlers
  - `onClick` to execute some action
- Debugging `state`:
  - `setState` is asynchronous
    - `debugger` gotcha
  - `setState` callback function
  - `render` as a way to also test `setState`
- Binding functions to use `setState`; why?
- `props` are arguments; `state` represents the state of your app

Why is all of this nice?
- Component isolation === reusability up up up!!

### Flow of Information in React

> `state` drives changes downwards

What does this really mean?
- Draw a picture to explain the flow of information.
- For more context, we need to see more of _Thinking in React_.
