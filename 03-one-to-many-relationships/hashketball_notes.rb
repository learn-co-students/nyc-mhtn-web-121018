# * Use `puts` to help understand code flow / program execution
# * Use `.class` to check data types
# * Understand what can be done to different data types
#   * (ex: can't add a number to an array, a hash cannot be capitalized)
# * Use `pry` to investigate the code
#   * If you `pry` above the code, it won't exist!
#   * If you `pry` after an error, you'll never hit the `pry`
# * Googling, reading docs, playing with code to understand it.

##### OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING #####
#######################################

# EVERYTHING IS AN OBJECT IN RUBY!
#   What is an object?
#     an object is a thing that
#     responds to message to do work (methods)
#   Objects have methods. They respond to messages to do work.
#   They cannot respond to messages (methods) that they don't
#   understand! NoMethodError!!

#   So...
#     Numbers do numbery things.
#     Arrays do array things.
#     Hashes do hashy things.
#     The things inside Arrays and Hashes are other objects.
#     Those objects have their own type that tells you what
#     they can do!

# Ruby
# - Syntactic Sugar => makes some syntax much nicer


# THE PROBLEM!
#   Consider these two Hashes. What do they represent?
jeff_adrien = { player_name: "Jeff Adrien", number: 4, shoe: 18, points: 10, rebounds: 1, assists: 1, steals: 2, blocks: 7, slam_dunks: 2 }
bob = { name: "Bob", claws: true, weight: 10 }
#   These Hashes have different data.
#   They represent different objects.
#   A Hash of a player should be different from a Hash of a cat.
#   Logically, they should also have different methods
#   specific to them.
#   JUST LIKE how a Hash has different methods than a Fixnum.

# THE SOLUTION!
#   Create a custom class to represent a new type of object.
#   This class can now be used, just like the String class,
#   to make new instances of that type of object!
class Player # this has to be capitalized
  # Macros => Writes the getter and setter methods for us.

  # getter + setter methods in one macro
  attr_accessor :number, :shoe_size, :points, :rebounds, :assists, :steals, :blocks, :slam_dunks

  # writes our getter methods
  attr_reader :name #, :number, :shoe_size, :points, :rebounds, :assists, :steals, :blocks, :slam_dunks

    @@all << self # self in the initialize method is the instance being made
  end

    # So ask yourself, who called me? => That's self!
    #   self in an instance method is the instance that called it
    # Because we have access to self, the instance,
    # logically it makes sense that we can use other
    # instance methods in here!

  ## NEW PROBLEM... (see below) ##

  # Called with Player.all
  def self.all
    @@all # in this class method, we are writing
          # a getter to retrieve the @@all class variable

  ## QUESTION!
  #   Those Hashketball methods, where do they belong?
  # => Outside the class?
  # => Inside the class as instance methods?
  # => Inside the class as class methods?
  #
  #   Think about what work the method is meant to do.
  #   Think about whose responsibility it is to do those methods.
  #   Who should you ask to run those methods?
  # => ANSWER: The class!

  # Arguments:
  #   player_name => String
  # Return => Player instance
  def self.find_player(player_name)
    self # <= what is this?
    # The class called it, so it should be Player!
    # What might be useful for Player?

    # class variables can be accessed
    # in both class and instance methods
    # So if we want all of the Players,
    # we can get it via @@all since we are inside of Player!
    @@all.find do |player| # Player instance
      # String (via getter) # String

# Making instances of a Player
# => No longer a Hash!

p10 = Player.new("Brendan Haywood", 33, 15, 6, 12, 12, 22, 5, 12)

## NEW PROBLEM!
#   We have all those nifty methods for searching for
#   specific player stats/information.
#   While we can just ask these player instances directly,
p1.points # num_points_scored
p1.shoe_size # shoe_size
# We'd have to know who to ask first.
# In Hashketball, we had methods to help us locate a player
# and then ask them for their data.
# => all_players
# => find_player
# But those required a collection (directory, yellow pages)
# of the players to work.
## BAD SOLUTION
#   We could store all the player instances in a global array
#   as we make them.
#   Then use that global array as our all_players:
$all_players = []
$all_players << p1
$all_players << p2
# etc...
# But if we imagine our app growing huge for all 300+ players,
# this becomes a pain. Also, GLOBAL VARIABLES ARE BAD!

## THE SOLUTION!
#   Wouldn't it be nice if we could ask the Player class
#   and have us tell it information about all Player things
#   (objects, instances)?
#   Just like how we can ask an individual player [instance]
#   for information about just that player?
# => ENTER CLASS VARIABLE && CLASS METHODS!

# We can even make a Cat class now for cat objects!
